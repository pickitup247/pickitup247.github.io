# Xprite

## Goal

The mission of Xprite is to make drawing correct pixels less painful, so you can focus on creating art. We invented lots of algorithmic tools specifically for pixel art. If you think it's missing a feature, feel free to email us your requests.

## Development

> After 6 months of coding, Xprite is finally ready for release. There are still a few bugs left to fix and features to build. Place an order now to support development:
> # [Preorder now](./xprite-order.html)

## Wanted: Xprite Art

Finally, we are looking for a spectacular piece of pixel art created with Xprite to feature on the splash screen everytime Xprite boots up. Feel free to email us your best work.

## Feedback

We are always happy to receive feedback from users, feel free to [contact us](/contact.md).
